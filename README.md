## 18 MTS Datasets

The 18 MTS (Multivariate Time Series) benchmark data sets can download from [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xxWMMqN5FrkbIWjsze_reg). They are collected from different repository, such as UCI, UCR and so on. These benchmark data sets come from various fields and have various input ranges and different numbers of classes, variables, and instances. 

The `.p` file are lists of three numpy arrays with `[samples, lables, original_lengths]`.  Meanwhile,

```
samples.shape = (number of instances, time length, number of variables)
labels.shape = (number of instances,)
original_lengths.shape = (number of instances,)
```

You can create a folder `dataset` and put the datasets in the folder.


## Usage

You can run the command 
```
python AD.py
```
to test the model on the ASD dataset.
